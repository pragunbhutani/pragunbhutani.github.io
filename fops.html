            <p>
                Hello friends, you are cordially invited to my house on Friday, the 6th of March from 7 PM onwards to celebrate my not-yet-30th birthday.
            </p>

            <p>
                The weather should be nice and breezy (maybe a splash of rain), we'll have some music, a DIY Gin station, some finger foods, social games and equipment for people to draw or paint.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your +1s, +2s or +Ns are welcome too, just let me know ahead of time so I can make sure there's enough to eat and drink.
            </p>

            <p>
                I look forward to seeing you!
            </p>
