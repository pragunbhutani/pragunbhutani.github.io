                Hi friends you are cordially invited to my not yet 30 hbd party tomorrow at 7 pm.
            </p>

            <p>
                Since I'm old and out of touch I'm ripping off my cool and hip sister's drawing/games/DIY gin party.
            </p>

            <p>
                The weather should be nice and breezy (maybe a splash of rain), we'll have some music and did I mention that it's Friday? It's Friday.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your +1s, +2s or +Ns are welcome too, just let me know ahead of time so I can make sure there's enough to eat and drink.
            </p>

            <p>
                I look forward to seeing you! HMU for address and all that jazz. If you don't know how to reach out to me you prolly shouldn't be seeing this so kthxbai.
